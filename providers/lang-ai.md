# Lang.ai

## Overview
Lang.ai focuses on **intent detection, real‑time auto‑tagging, and routing/triage**. It's a natural fit when the ask is "smarter triage + macros" in Zendesk (vs. a full customer‑facing chatbot).

## Key Features
- **Real‑time tagging** to automate routing, prioritization, and macro suggestions.
- **Granular taxonomy**: Visual concept/tag building + insights.
- **Flexible connectors & API** for ticket/data pipelines; supports Power Platform connector.
- **Usage‑based pricing model** (per rows processed per AI agent).

## Use Cases
- Auto‑classify and route Zendesk tickets; power SLA/priority queues.
- Macro suggestions and backlog cleanup.
- Analytics on intents/drivers without rebuilding your bot stack.

## Pricing
- Usage‑based (rows processed per AI agent/month) with volume discounts.

## Integration
- **Zendesk**: Official **Lang for Support** app; dedicated integration guides.
- **Intercom**: Intercom‑centric demos and Lang's own help center runs on Intercom; confirm production integration path during discovery.
- **Ecosystem**: Power Platform connector; webhooks/API for custom flows.

## Comparison Points
- Best for **triage/ops intelligence** vs. front‑end chat automation.
- Minimal disruption to existing agent workflows.
- Useful precursor/companion to any chatbot rollout.
