# QuickMail

## Quick Context
Australian‑founded cold email tool built by practitioners. **Inbox Rotation** scales volume across many mailboxes; **flat pricing per account** with **unlimited users** on non‑starter tiers.

## Pricing Structure
- **Starter:** **$9/mo** — 1 email sender, 1 LinkedIn account, 1 user, **3,000 emails/mo** (trial **14 days**, card required but **no auto‑charge on trial end**).  
- **Growth:** **$99/mo** — **Unlimited email senders & LinkedIn accounts**, **unlimited users**, **100,000 emails/mo**, **30,000 contacts** (+$10 per +10k).  
- **Agency:** **$299/mo** — unlimited senders/users, **300,000 emails/mo**, **50,000 contacts**, 2 workspaces (+$49 each), API & Webhook.  
- **Seat model:** Not per‑seat—**unlimited users** on Growth/Agency.

## Email Sending Limits
- Plan caps are **monthly** (3k / 100k / 300k emails).  
- **Inbox Rotation** splits volume across added inboxes to avoid tripping ESP heuristics.  
- Emails send **through your provider’s IPs/servers** (Gmail/Microsoft, etc.), not QuickMail’s.

## Deliverability Method
- **Inbox Rotation**, staged ramp, and AutoWarmer via MailFlow included.  
- Emphasis on sending through **your own mailbox infrastructure**.

## CRM Integrations
- **HubSpot & Pipedrive** integrations with **two‑way sync** (per app pages).  
- Also integrates with Slack, Twilio, Aircall, and Zapier; API/Webhooks on higher tiers.

## Setup Requirements
- **Time to first campaign:** Same day; add mailboxes and set sending windows.  
- **Technical:** Follow ESP limits and DNS best practices; warm mailboxes before scale.

## Unique Positioning
- **Best for:** Small teams/agencies wanting **simple scaling** by adding inboxes with **no per‑seat fees**.  
- **Not great for:** Teams seeking built‑in dialers or large data enrichment.  
- **Differentiator:** **Inbox Rotation** with unlimited senders/users at Growth/Agency.

## Common Questions & Answers
