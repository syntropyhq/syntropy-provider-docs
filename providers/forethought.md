# Forethought

## Overview
Forethought (SupportGPT) is an AI‑first support platform that combines **deflection**, **triage**, and **agent assist** into a multi‑agent system. It plays well when knowledge quality varies and you want both a copilot and measurable ticket deflection.

## Key Features
- **Solve (AI Agent)**: Generative answers + full‑cycle resolution with smooth handoff.
- **Triage**: Smart, model‑driven classification and routing.
- **Assist (Copilot)**: In‑agent recommendations and content surfacing in Zendesk.
- **Integrations**: 70+ connectors across helpdesks, CRMs, and KBs.

## Use Cases
- Deflect FAQs while preserving accuracy when KB quality is uneven.
- Speed up agents with suggested replies and relevant content.
- Route/auto‑tag tickets to reduce backlogs and handle spikes.

## Pricing
- Quote-based. Public site directs buyers to request pricing/learn more.

## Integration
- **Zendesk**: Official **Forethought Assist** app in the Zendesk Marketplace.
- **Intercom**: Forethought states seamless integration with **Intercom** (alongside Zendesk/Salesforce).
- **Ecosystem**: 70+ connectors; API‑driven multi‑agent platform.

## Comparison Points
- **"Copilot + deflect"** narrative vs. bot‑only tools.
- Multi‑agent architecture vs. single‑agent chatbots.
- Strong when you need end‑to‑end: **Solve + Triage + Assist**.
