# Apollo.io

## Quick Context
Combines a **large B2B contact database (265M+ contacts)** with outreach/sequence automation and CRM enrichment—database + engagement in one tool.

## Pricing Structure
- **Free** plan available; **paid tiers start at $49/user/mo** (per Apollo site).  
- “Unlimited” plans are subject to **Fair Use** (e.g., credit ceilings; see policy).  
- Trials and credits included on sign‑up; details are dynamic on pricing page.

## Email Sending Limits
- **Default sending safety:** **50 emails/day**, **6/hour**, **10‑minute delay** between batches.  
- **Connected mailboxes:** **Up to 15 mailboxes per user** (plan‑dependent).  
- Limits are adjustable; Apollo recommends staying within defaults to protect domain reputation.

## Deliverability Method
- Sends via your mailboxes (Gmail/Outlook, etc.).  
- Supports **custom tracking subdomains** to protect primary domain reputation.

## CRM Integrations
- **Native:** HubSpot and Salesforce; **one CRM at a time** per account.  
- **Bi‑directional sync** for contacts/accounts/deals; Apollo provides sync guidance and staging windows (e.g., 6‑hour configuration window on HubSpot enablement).

## Setup Requirements
- **Time to first campaign:** Same day once mailboxes are connected; warmup and DNS/auth recommended.  
- **Technical:** Optionally set a **custom tracking subdomain**; follow deliverability best practices.

## Unique Positioning
- **Best for:** Teams that want **data + engagement** out of one platform (prospecting + sequences + enrichment).  
- **Not great for:** Orgs already locked into a separate data provider and only seeking a sequencer.  
- **Differentiator:** Scale of data (265M+), enrichment, and engagement workflow in a single UI.

## Common Questions & Answers
**Q: Can a 5‑rep team send 500/day each?**  
A: Apollo’s defaults are **50/day and 6/hour per mailbox**. To safely reach 500/day per rep you’ll need multiple warmed mailboxes per rep and staged ramp‑up.

**Q: Pipedrive? Salesforce? HubSpot?**  
A: **Salesforce & HubSpot** are native and **bi‑directional**; Pipedrive appears in Apollo’s sync overview as a supported CRM context. Only **one CRM** can be connected at a time.

**Q: Go‑live timeline?**  
A: Same day for light sending; allocate time for mailbox warmup, DNS, and CRM field mapping before scaling.
